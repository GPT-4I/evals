Avoid simply stating the correct answer at the outset. Then print only a single choice from \"Yes\" or \"No\" (without quotes or punctuation) on its own line corresponding to the correct answer. At the end, repeat just the answer by itself on a new line.\n\nReasoning:"}],"sampled":["1. The first response acknowledges and appreciates the willingness to assist, showing gratitude.\n2. The first response indicates that the user will reach out if they have any further questions or need help with anything else.\n3.
