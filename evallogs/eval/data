You must provide one answer based on your subjective view.\n\nFirst, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning to be sure that your conclusion is correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answer at the outset. Then print only a single choice from \"Yes\" or \"No\" (without quotes or punctuation) on its own line corresponding to the correct answer. At the end, repeat just the answer by itself on a new line.\n\nReasoning:"}],"sampled":["1. Both responses express gratitude and offer further assistance.\n2. Response 1 is concise and to the point, while still being friendly and positive.\n3. Response 2 acknowledges the user's feelings and offers additional support and reassurance.\n4.
