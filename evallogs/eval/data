If you have any other questions or need assistance with something else, feel free to ask.

You must provide one answer based on your subjective view.\n\nFirst, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning to be sure that your conclusion is correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answer at the outset. Then print only a single choice from \"Yes\" or \"No\" (without quotes or punctuation) on its own line corresponding to the correct answer. At the end, repeat just the answer by itself on a new line.\n\nReasoning:"}],"sampled":["1. Both responses acknowledge the user's statement and provide a similar explanation for the AI's limitations.\n2. Response 1 offers additional assistance and invites the user to ask any other questions or seek further help.\n3. Response 2 only provides the same explanation without any additional offer of assistance.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the first response is better than the second.\n\nYes"]}
