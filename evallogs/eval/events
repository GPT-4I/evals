You must provide one answer based on your subjective view.\n\nFirst, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning to be sure that your conclusion is correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answer at the outset. Then print only a single choice from \"Yes\" or \"No\" (without quotes or punctuation) on its own line corresponding to the correct answer. At the end, repeat just the answer by itself on a new line.\n\nReasoning:"}],"sampled":["1. Both responses express gratitude for the kind words and support received.\n2. Both responses acknowledge the importance of knowing that there are people who care and are willing to offer support.\n3. Both responses encourage the person to reach out if they ever need someone to talk to.\n4. Both responses wish the person a wonderful day.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, it can be concluded that the first response is not necessarily better than the second response. Both responses effectively convey gratitude, support, and encouragement. \n\nNo"]},"created_by":"","created_at":1690536946310}
